I used StackOverflow, AskBCS, and the internet for assistance with writing the code as well as with the errors I encountered. I actually had an extremely hard time with this challenge. This was in the beginning when I was attempting to set up Spark and Java but Google Colab ended up being the most helpful for the initialization.
